# How we use Forecast

## GitHub - Project integration

All Forecast projects that involve code, needs to have a linked GitHub Repository.

The GitHub integration is a 2-way sync of Forecast Task with GitHub Issues. This means that every task in Forecast, exists as an issue on the linked repository. Assignees\*, labels, description, comments and milestones/phases are also syncronised.

The integration is set up per project. Go to 'Settings' -> 'Integrations' and scroll down to select a repository. Please only select 1 repository, even if Forecast let's you select multiple. We _cannot_ synchronise 1 project with multiple repositories. For Forecast projects that require multiple repositories, refer to the Kvalifik-CLI documentation for our workaround.

\* Requires a linked GitHub profile. See \_\_\_ for how to set this up.

## GitHub - Linked profile

Like our projects, all Forecast profiles should be integrated with GitHub. This is especially helpful when assigning tasks, as this is synchronised between Forecast & GitHub.

To link your GitHub account to Forecast, go to ['My Profile'](https://app.forecast.it/my-profile/profile), and scroll down to the bottom. When successfully linked, it should look like this:
