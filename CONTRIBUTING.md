# Contributing to "How We Work"
How We Work is both a place of documentation and standardization. It is a public repository, so everyone can see everything in the repository alongside on [docs.kvalifik.dk](https://docs.kvalifik.dk/).
The website is hosted on Jekyll and is updated on every push to production.

# Finding a subject
Each subject is written as a task on the Developer Team Forecast board and has the label "HowWeWork".

# Writing a page
Each page is written in Markdown should be able to be interpreted by Jekyll. Content-wise, it is important to remember the premise of this documentation: It is about How we work, not Why we work or How to work. It is not a tutorial on using specific tools or languages nor an in-depth guide to why our processes are like they are, but merely a description of our processes and standards for future reference.
